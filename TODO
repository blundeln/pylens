TODO
----

target: 1.0.0b1
  - Allow the definition of arbitrary type containers.
    - This is what I have been heading towards.
    - Alter obj attr names to be valid python variables.
  - More example lenses.
    - Need a good example in main README to show what the framework allows
  - Regex lens? Might as well since we have a cheeky Until lens

target: 1.0.0b2
  - Allow label alignment proper (e.g. if label changes move item)

target: 1.0.0rc1
  - Polish code (mainly comments, etc.)
  - Docs, site and bug tracker set up for launch.


target: future
  - Use of auto containers for convenience of when none is specified.
  - Port for python 3
  - How to handle default indentation in recursive grammars.
  - DynamicLens - pass a function which creates a lens when it is called with
    context params (e.g. current collection) e.g. <X> .... </X>
  - Ambiguity checking.
  - Apache lens example would be an important milestone?
