Refactoring
  - Add or improve  full test coverage for refactored code.
  - Add basic dict container to demonstrate keys.
  - Start to build up lenses.
  - encapsulate debug routines for optional inclusion
    - especially the formatting of debug messages which can add a significant overhead.

target: 1.0.0a1
  - Complete Recursion
    - Need to test works correctly in both directions.
  - Improve examples in long_tests.py
    - Need to have a good think about how to create richer models
  - Add installation script
  - Publish on freshmeat

target: 1.0.0a2
  - Make compatible with python 3
  - Improve basic docs


target: future
  - Store residue of get for more flexible matching.
  - How to handle default indentation in recursive grammars.
  - Shorter syntax for differentiating between store and non-store lenses so parsers less cluttered
    - e.g. Word(...) vs S(Word(...)), or something
  - DynamicLens - pass a function which creates a lens when it is called with
    context params (e.g. current collection) e.g. <X> .... </X>
  - Ambiguity checking.
  - Implement PutGet check for sanity checking lenses.
  - Implement full lenses for deb conf and interfaces.
  - Apache lens
  - How can we simplify the lens definition?
    - Context of lens definition -> auto whitespace
  - Alter obj attr names to be valid python variables.
