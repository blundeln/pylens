TODO
----

target: 1.0.0a1
  - Remove old code, and improve code clarity with comments and API docs
  - Basic lenses using native containers (dict and list)
  - Installation and packaging code
  - Publish on freshmeat

target: 1.0.0a2
  - Allow label alignment (e.g. if label changes move item)

target: 1.0.0a3
  - Allow class containers.
  - Alter obj attr names to be valid python variables.


target: future
  - Use of auto containers for convenience of when none is specified.
  - Make compatible with python 3
  - How to handle default indentation in recursive grammars.
  - Shorter syntax for differentiating between store and non-store lenses so parsers less cluttered
    - e.g. Word(...) vs S(Word(...)), or something
  - DynamicLens - pass a function which creates a lens when it is called with
    context params (e.g. current collection) e.g. <X> .... </X>
  - Ambiguity checking.
  - Apache lens?
  - How can we simplify the lens definition?
    - Context of lens definition -> auto whitespace
