TODO
----
target: 1.0.0a1
  - Fix up user model class casting.
    - Support of __new__ for de-serialisation.
  - Check through all code and improve comments and structure
    - Collection stuff
  - Complete Recurse Lens
   - Freeze recursion
  - Add installation script
  - Improve basic docs
  - encapsulate debug routines for optional inclusion
    - especially the formatting of debug messages which can add a significant overhead.

target: future
  - Should CombineChars be replaced by type=str or something, a more fundamental approach?
  - Shorter syntax for differentiating between store and non-store lenses so parsers less cluttered
    - e.g. Word(...) vs S(Word(...)), or something
    - rather than: Word(store=False) vs Word(store=True)
  - Need a way of accurately testing performance, since currently many tests require (slow) debug strings
    to validate output
  - DynamicLens - pass a function which creates a lens when it is called with
    context params (e.g. current collection)
  - Ambiguity check.
  - Add API docs to code.
  - Implement PutGet check for sanity checking lenses.
  - Implement full lenses for deb conf and interfaces.
  - Apache lens
  - How can we simplify the lens definition?
    - Context of lens definition -> auto whitespace
  - Alter obj attr names to be valid python variables.
