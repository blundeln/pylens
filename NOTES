RESEARCH NOTES
  - Revision of PUT
    - Incremental changes
      - Check all tests are sensible with new PUT (i.e. don't use CREATE).
        before trusting results.
    - Create a simple mathcing test such as: a------bx-y <--> [[a,b][x,y]]
  - Reorganise code:
    - storage.py -> item things, containers, input reader
  - Remember: stuff on stash
  - Use of keys and labels: lens designer can set arbitrary lens options
    - Should be simplified greatly by PUT revision, though still need careful
      thought.
    - When returning items, ensure set_key is called to update cont key.
    - Think about how best to handle setting a key on a item that was passed
      from user which does not contain its key.
      - On reflection, seems better to wrap in a group, though we could use
        auto_list idea and a wrapper of group: KeyValue(X(is_key) + "==>" +
        Y(type=P)) --> Group(<lens>, type=auto_list)
    - Still, during create, we may make a bad choice of several candidates of
      items to put into a given lens, so might be best to let container handle
      put, such that it can flexibly make tentitive puts on certain tokens.
      - Though we can certainly hone our candidate selection based on lens type
      - Correctly handle auto_list in candidate selection.
    - In general, if a container can store items correctly from lenses, it must
      be able to put them back or create them correctly.
  - Could we have type=str on container lens rather than combine chars?
  - Group should take only non-typed lens?
  - Create KeyValue lens
  - Could have containers in container, multiplex store and consume.
  - Find nice way to add simple tracing messages so we can see what's going on
  - If any kargs set on a lens, assume is a store using default type of str
  - Think about how to best implement auto list idea
  - TESTS inheritance, makes it difficult to disable tests by changing function
    name.
  
  - Optimisations
    - Concering containers:
      - How to know whether a given lens may modify a container or input
      - How to know efficiently if a lens has modifed a container
        - Dirty flag idea may fail with overwrites by nested lenses
        - Listened objecj sounds good, but how to account for state reset
    - Concerning Rollbackables
      - Find solution to efficient object rollback, avoiding blanket deepcopy - use aspects, perhaps?
      - I think we only need two copies when we re-use the original state, such as in Or
    - Concering meta data
      - It does not make sense for all lens items to carry their input string (e.g. AO) since they do not interleve input with created values.
