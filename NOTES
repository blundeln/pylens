RESEARCH NOTES
  - Use common sub-lens attribute - self._lenses to aid interigation
    - Example: check if a lens or its sublenses may consume items.
  - Find solution to efficient object rollback, avoiding blanket deepcopy - use aspects, perhaps?
  - Or go with first to succeed and allow lens author to set order.
