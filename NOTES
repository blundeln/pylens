NOTES
 - When does an aggregate lens need to distinguish itself as a store lens, if at all?
  - Or is interesting
  - in BaseLens.get() store is checked to decide whether or not to store the token if there is a token
    - Thus, Or should be store if at least one lens is a store to ensure it gets stored.
