RESEARCH NOTES
  - What does it mean to pass a None item to put on an non-typed lens
  - Find nice way to add simple tracing messages so we can see what's going on
  - If any kargs set on a lens, assume is a store using default type of str
  - Use of keys and labels: lens can set kargs: key (of next lens with label=current_key) or container_key
    - Think about how best to handle setting a key on a item that was passed
      from user which does not contain its key.
  - Think about how to best implement auto list idea
  - TESTS inheritance, makes it difficult to disable tests by changin function
    name.
  
  - Optimisations
    - Concering containers:
      - How to know whether a given lens may modify a container or input
      - How to know efficiently if a lens has modifed a container
        - Dirty flag idea may fail with overwrites by nested lenses
        - Listened objecj sounds good, but how to account for state reset
    - Concerning Rollbackables
      - Find solution to efficient object rollback, avoiding blanket deepcopy - use aspects, perhaps?
      - I think we only need two copies when we re-use the original state, such as in Or
